# Snappy Book Review

Snappy Book Review is a little book review website written in TypeScript. It 
uses Express.js as its backend framework and MongoDB as its database. Its 
CSS preprocessor is SASS, using the newer SCSS syntax.

This project's prototype was written in PHP and used MySQL as its database. 
You can check it out on the project-prototype branch.
However, the limitations of this stack were quickly discovered. Its developers 
explored many other stacks and settled on the ME_N stack. (The underscore, the 
backend framework isn't decided yet - that's why it is left blank.) 

This "new" version of this project is still under development. We're looking 
forward for contributors who can help developing this project! Most 
importantly we need a web designer!

# Snappy Book Review

Snappy Book Review is a little book review website written in TypeScript. It
uses Express.js as its backend framework and MongoDB as its database. Its
CSS preprocessor is SASS, using the newer SCSS syntax.

Setup is very simple: Run `setup.ts`, enter all details, and you're good to go.
Simply enter the command `npm start` in your terminal and the app will start
up.

App is live at [snappy-book-review.herokuapp.com](snappy-book-review.herokuapp.com).
